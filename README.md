# Cloud Cost Comparison #

## Abstract: ##

Hosting Cloud applications or services are ongoing need for Students, small organization just like large enterprises.
Large Enterprises hire cloud-consulting services.
For Students and small organizations, it is difficult to make choice of Cloud Service provider & where to start.

## Introduction: ##

Complexity increases with lot of available configuration as part of cloud services.
Cloud comparison application can get easy start on needs for basic cloud services 
Cloud comparison application can provide easy way to compare cost
Users can customize basic options like currency, region to understand impact on cost

 ## Significance: ##

Lot of blogs, forums has comparison study of Cloud Service Providers
Lack of options for easy comparison for users with limited understanding on basics of cloud
Aimed to provide Simple and easy UI to understand

 ## Problem Statement:  ##

For students, organizations with limited budget needs easy way to start understanding basic of cloud components
Can get overwhelming with multiple configurations available as service providers and options provided 
Difficult to understand what cloud services are needed for applications
Reading through various blogs, product documentation & video is complex

 ## Research Question  ##

1 What are basic components of Cloud hosting? </br>
2 What are different pricing model for Cloud Service Providers?  </br>
3 How cloud service providers price compares?  </br>

 ## Analysis  ##

 ## System Architecture  ##

System has 3 major components. 
1 backend server which serves user with GUI 
2 API services module which pulls price data from Cloud Service provider like AWS, Azure and loads into flat file systems
3 Database is flat files and updated peridiocally

 ## GUI ##

Graphical User Interface provides easy starting point for user with limited understanding of cloud.
For users who just needs services and need scalability it shows static page with PaaS as solution with all components available in Cloud Service Providers.
For advanced users it provide interactive UI for IaaS with price details for various combination

Research questions are addressed in application i.e. it covered what are building blocks of Cloud, price comparision, options based on user needs

Starting point of application

Free or limited cost option using Platform as service and what are options availble with each Vendor

For advanced user with complex needs where PaaS is not option but needs Infrastructure as Service then how cost varies with configuration.

## Conclusion ##

Desiging Cloud Service Provider comparision application serves motivation to increase adoption of cloud services across student community and use best configuration which are cost effective.
